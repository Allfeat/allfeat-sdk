/**
 * Enum representing all major and minor keys, including sharps, flats,
 * and their enharmonic equivalents.
 *
 * This can be used to specify the musical key of a track or composition
 * with precise notation.
 *
 * # Naming Convention
 *
 * - `m` suffix indicates minor keys
 * - `s` suffix indicates sharp (#)
 * - `b` suffix indicates flat (â™­)
 * - Enharmonic equivalents are preserved for exact notation
 *
 * # Examples
 *
 * ```rust
 * use allfeat_midds_v2::shared::Key;
 *
 * let c_major = Key::C;
 * let a_minor = Key::Am;
 * let f_sharp_major = Key::Fs;
 * let g_flat_major = Key::Gb; // Enharmonic equivalent of F#
 * ```
